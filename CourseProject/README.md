Getting and Cleaning Data - Course Project
========================================================
Introduction
--------------------------------------------------------
This repo contains my course project for the Getting and Cleaning Data course. It countains a README, CodeBook, the 'tidydata' data set , and the r code for creating the final tidy data set.

The 'run_analysis' script does the following:

    1. Read the required data from train and test folders as well as the features file
    2. Do the required transformation to create the desired data set
    3. Write the outputdata to the tidydata.txt file
    
Steps to work on this project
--------------------------------------------------------
    1. Download the data source and unzip in your working directory.
    2. Move run_analysis.R in the working directory.
    3. Run 'source("run_analysis.R")' and the 'tidaydata.txt' will be generated in your working directory.
